### Design/Development Notes

This app was built as a group project with my classmates at my coding bootcamp course at UCI.  It was built using:

* Node.JS / Express.JS
* MySQL / Sequelize
* Foundation CSS
* REST API / CRUD methodology

My own contribution to the project primarily involved setting up the SQL/Sequelize schemas and table definitions as well as connecting the REST routes between the front and back end of the app.
